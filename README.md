# Universal Destructor
General purpose compatibility addon for Hideous Destructor, a gameplay mod for
Doom using the GZDoom engine.

Universal Destructor enables you to play Hideous Destructor with monster packs, adding minimal features from Hideous Destructor automatically to monsters' attacks, such as fireballs actually igniting the player or hitscan attacks being replaced with simulated bullets. Universal Destructor is not guaranteed to work for any particular monster, monster pack, or monster randomizer and is provided as-is.
